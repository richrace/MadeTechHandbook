# Made Tech Handbook Mobile Application

This application scrapes all the links from the [Made Tech handbook repo](https://github.com/madetech/handbook) and constructs a simple application which allows users to more easily search for information from our handbook.

The application uses React Native. To run the application:

Reference the [React Native Getting Started docs](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started) to set up your project for testing on ios and android.

run `yarn ios` then `npm start`. Switch out `yarn ios` for `yarn android` to run the application on an android simulator.
